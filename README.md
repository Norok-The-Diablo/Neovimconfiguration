# My Vim And Neovim Configuration
This is my (Neo)Vim config with an easy updater for Windows and Linux. You just have to run the script according to your operating system as administrator to put the configurations in the right place.
Run ```pip3 install pynvim``` if you get errors about python. Otherwise, you just need to install ```node``` and ```npm``` for the LSP server
