# My Vim And Neovim Configuration
This is my (Neo)Vim config with an easy updater for Windows and Linux. You just have to run the script according to your operating system and it will put the configurations in the right place. Run the Install Font batch file as admin, and run the Windows copy script as admin the first time you run it, then run it again without admin.
Run ```pip3 install pynvim``` if you get errors about Python. Otherwise, you just need to install ```node``` and ```npm``` for the LSP server
